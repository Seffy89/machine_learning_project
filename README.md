Automated Baseline Model Selection and Reporting
Brief Description:

This project automates the identification of the best performing baseline model from a machine learning experiment and generates a comprehensive markdown report for deployment or cloud service integration.

Project Goals:

Standardize and automate baseline model selection based on performance metrics.
Generate a clear and concise markdown report summarizing key model information.
Improve project organization for easier deployment and collaboration.
Expected Outcomes:

A bash script (result_comparison.sh) for automated model selection and report generation.
A formatted markdown report (baseline_model_report.md) containing summaries for each model version.
Improved project structure with relevant files (confusion matrix image, baseline_model_results.csv)
Instructions for Usage:

Clone the project repository from GitHub.
Ensure you have awk, sed, and sort commands available on your system.
Run the script: bash result_comparison.sh
Review the generated baseline_model_report.md file containing the best model information.
Contribution Guidelines:

We welcome contributions to improve the script's functionality or enhance the report format.
